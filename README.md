# Distributed Happy Hour

Please join us for a remote-friendly, distributed happy hour on [Thursday, November 14 at 21:30 UTC / 16:30 EDT / 13:30 PDT](https://everytimezone.com/?t=5dcc9900,50a)!

We will meet via Zoom.

All attendees must abide by the following rules:

1.  Bring your own beverage of choice; no beverages will be provided as part of this happy hour, please bring your own beverage of choice ;)
2.  Use one of the backgrounds from [this repository](https://github.com/nathenharvey/conference-call-backgrounds).  It is OK if you do not have a green screen and the rendering is less than optimal, in fact, that might make the event even more fun for everyone!
3.  You must consent to screen shots of the happy hour being posted online.
4.  You must follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nathenharvey/conference-call-backgrounds/blob/master/CONDUCT.md); we are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Want to attend?  Email [Nathen Harvey](mailto:nathen.harvey@gmail.com?Subject=Please send calendar invite for the distributed happy hour) asking for a calendar invite with details of the event.
