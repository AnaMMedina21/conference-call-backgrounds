# Distributed Happy Hour

Please join us for a remote-friendly, distributed happy hour on [Tuesday, March 10 at 20:45 UTC / 16:45 EDT / 13:45 PDT](https://everytimezone.com/s/8e8615ab)!

We will meet via Zoom.

All attendees must abide by the following rules:

1.  **Bring your own beverage** of choice; no beverages will be provided as part of this happy hour, please bring your own beverage of choice ;)
2.  You must **consent to screen shots** of the happy hour being **posted online**.
3.  You must **follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nathenharvey/conference-call-backgrounds/blob/master/CONDUCT.md)**; we are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Attendees are encouraged to **use one of the backgrounds** from [this repository](https://github.com/nathenharvey/conference-call-backgrounds).  It is OK if you do not have a green screen and the rendering is less than optimal, in fact, that might make the event even more fun for everyone!


## Want to attend?

Email [Nathen Harvey](mailto:nathen.harvey@gmail.com?Subject=Distributed-Happy-Hour) asking for a calendar invite with details of the event.
