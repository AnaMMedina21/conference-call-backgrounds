# Distributed Happy Hour

Our next distributed happy hour will be held soon.  All attendees must abide by the following rules:

1.  **Bring your own beverage** of choice; no beverages will be provided as part of this happy hour, please bring your own beverage of choice ;)
2.  You must **consent to screen shots** of the happy hour being **posted online**.
3.  You must **follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nathenharvey/conference-call-backgrounds/blob/master/CONDUCT.md)**; we are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Attendees are encouraged to **use one of the backgrounds** from [this repository](https://github.com/nathenharvey/conference-call-backgrounds).  It is OK if you do not have a green screen and the rendering is less than optimal, in fact, that might make the event even more fun for everyone!
